# StrongTies User Guide

## Purpose and Intended Use

**StrongTies** is designed to help small, trusted groups of professionals support each other in their career journeys. The tool is built for real connections — people who know each other well, are willing to help, and want to make meaningful introductions to high-potential contacts. It is **not** intended for large, weakly connected networks.

StrongTies works best when used by groups of two or more first-degree connections who:

- Have genuine relationships and mutual trust.
- Are open to sharing their professional networks for the benefit of each other.
- Are actively seeking introductions to specific companies or roles.

## How to Use StrongTies

1. **Form Your Support Group**
   - Gather a small group (ideally 2–5 people) who are committed to helping each other.
   - Each member should be willing to share their exported LinkedIn-style connection data (names, companies, positions only).

2. **Prepare Your Data**
   - Export your connections from LinkedIn or similar platforms, ensuring only the required fields are included.
   - No emails, messages, or sensitive identifiers are needed or used.

3. **Load Data Locally**
   - Import your CSV files into StrongTies. All processing happens on your computer—your data is never uploaded or shared externally.

4. **Set Your Goals**
   - Define your target companies and roles. Share these with your group so everyone knows who is seeking what.

5. **Analyze and Collaborate**
   - Use StrongTies to visualize your combined network.
   - Identify which group members can introduce each other to high-potential contacts.
   - Review ranked lists of key connectors and suggested introduction paths.

6. **Take Action Together**
   - Coordinate outreach: ask your trusted connections for introductions, offer to make introductions for others, and support each other's job search.

## Ethical Principles

- **Privacy First:** Your data stays local. StrongTies never collects, uploads, or infers sensitive information.
- **Reciprocity:** The tool is built for mutual support, not for exploiting networks.
- **Transparency:** All analysis is explainable and inspectable.
- **Noncommercial Use:** StrongTies is free for personal and group use, not for commercial recruitment or marketing.

## Who Should *Not* Use StrongTies

- Large, anonymous groups with weak or superficial connections.
- Users seeking to mass-contact or "farm" introductions.
- Anyone intending to use the tool for commercial, marketing, or surveillance purposes.

## Summary

StrongTies empowers small, trusted groups to strategically support each other's career goals by making thoughtful, high-impact introductions. Use it to deepen your professional relationships, not to expand them indiscriminately.
