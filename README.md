# StrongTies – A Networking Insights Tool
**Find the people in your network who can open doors — and the ones you can help in return.**

StrongTies is a **noncommercial, source-available application** that gives job seekers and professionals insight into their LinkedIn connection network. By importing your connections (names, titles, and companies only; no emails or messages), the tool builds a social graph of your first- and second-degree contacts and uses network-analysis methods to identify:

- Which of your direct contacts are positioned to introduce you to your target companies  
- Which of your second-degree contacts are within reach via warm introductions  
- How clusters of connections overlap to create stronger paths for outreach  

Networking becomes less about hoping and more about strategy. With StrongTies you get actionable insight into who to connect with — and how to do it in a way that supports your goals, while honoring your network.

## Why StrongTies Matters
Traditional networking advice often leaves you asking: *Who should I reach out to? Through whom?* StrongTies takes the guesswork out of that process. Based on social-network theory and real data, it highlights where opportunity lives in your network, so you can spend time where it counts.

## How It Works
1. **Export Connection Data** – Export your LinkedIn connections, providing name + company fields only.  
2. **Graph Construction** – StrongTies builds a network graph: people are vertices; relationships are edges.  
3. **Analysis Metrics** – The tool calculates centrality measures (e.g., betweenness, closeness) and community structure to detect strong introduction paths.  
4. **Insight Output** – You receive a ranked list of high-potential connections and optional visualizations of your network.  
> _All processing happens locally or via open-source code; no sensitive data is shared._
