# Networking Principles: Architecting Your Professional Network

### Purpose

This document distills the practical strategies presented in *Deep Professional Networks* (2025) into actionable principles for building authentic, effective, and durable professional relationships. These principles align with the broader goals of **StrongTies** — promoting meaningful, data-informed connections for career development and opportunity discovery.

## 1. The Marketing Plan

The greatest advantage in developing your professional network is knowing **what you want**.  
Intentionality allows others to help you more effectively.

A **marketing plan** organizes your career priorities and articulates the following:

- The **roles** you seek and **why** you seek them.  
- The **value** you bring to employers.  
- The **organizations** and **industries** that align with your goals.

Professionals are problem-solvers; clarity gives them something concrete to help with.  
Vague requests like *“Please forward my résumé to anyone who might be interested”* are too open-ended and transactional.

If you cannot yet articulate your goals clearly, ask your network for help **in developing** those answers.

---

## 2. Elements of a Marketing Plan

### A. Objective Statement

A concise explanation of the work you are seeking.  
It should communicate, in clear terms:

- **What** kind of work you want to do.  
- **Why** you want to do it.  
- **What skills** you bring.  
- **How** you differentiate yourself from others.

Refine this statement over time and incorporate it into your networking conversations.  
It helps contacts connect you with relevant opportunities and prevents “any job” from replacing “the right job.”

---

### B. Target Markets

Define and focus your search using **clear market criteria** such as:

- Geography (remote vs. on-site)  
- Cost of living  
- Compensation bands for your market value  
- Relevant industries  
- “Atoms vs. Bits” — physical goods vs. digital products  
- Organization size (ARR, headcount)  
- Organization maturity (startup, IPO, legacy)

Your target markets are **not permanent** — adjust them as you learn and grow.  
Concrete focus prevents wasted effort and helps your contacts help you effectively.

---

### C. Target Companies

Once your target markets are defined, identify **specific companies** to investigate — typically around **20+**, depending on industry.

These are where you should first seek to develop or strengthen network ties.  
Being proactive reduces chance dependence and builds momentum.

Consider “**growth roles**” — positions that might not be your ultimate goal but build the skills and relationships that prepare you for it.  
However, take such roles **with the intent to excel**, not merely as stepping stones.

---

## 3. The Right Mindset

Networking is about **connecting with people**, not transactions.  
A purely transactional mindset misuses everyone’s time.

Remember:

- Authentic relationships are the foundation of opportunity.  
- Networking benefits both parties — it is a civic good that strengthens the professional community.  
- The aim is not just to find jobs, but to **create opportunities for meaningful introductions**.

Build as strong and authentic a network as you can manage genuinely.

---

## 4. Preparing to Network

Preparation translates intention into effective action.

**Checklist:**

- A well-formatted, current, professional résumé.  
- A rehearsed, authentic objective statement.  
- A consistent schedule and workspace for networking activities.  
- A simple record-keeping system for planning, thank-yous, and follow-ups.

Dedicate **80% of your job search effort to networking** and **20% to direct applications**.  
Networking is the compounding activity that builds long-term opportunity.

---

## 5. Building Your Network

Start by surveying your **existing 1st- and 2nd-degree connections** at target companies.

Tools and sources include:

- LinkedIn (for overlap and shared affiliations)  
- Alumni networks  
- Professional associations  
- Colleagues, mentors, and local networking groups

Focus first on **1st-degree connections** — people who already know you.  
These are warm entry points for practice and momentum.

---

## 6. Working the Process

The key principle:  
> You are asking for **advice, insights, referrals, and mentoring** — not for jobs.

**Suggested Process:**

1. **Written outreach:**  
   Briefly explain your purpose (e.g., job search, staying in touch, learning about the company).  
   Request a 30-minute conversation.

2. **In-person or virtual meeting:**  
   Make it mutually beneficial. Offer value where you can — insight, referrals, or support.

3. **Follow up:**  
   Send a thank-you note and confirm next steps.  
   Commit to keeping your contact informed, and follow through.

> “When you ask for a job, you get advice. When you ask for advice, you may get offered a job.”

---

## 7. Referrals and Second-Degree Connections

Referrals are the **network bridges** that convert 2nd-degree ties into 1st-degree relationships.

After sharing your objective statement and marketing plan, ask trusted 1st-degree contacts if they know **1–3 people** who could offer perspective or guidance.

When reaching out:

- Mention your mutual contact (with permission).  
- Focus on learning and advice, not direct job requests.  
- Always follow up with gratitude and updates.

Treat every “no” as a **pivot point** — an opportunity to ask a smaller or different question.

---

## 8. Converting Connections to Job Referrals

When you’ve aligned your objective statement and identified a relevant opportunity:

- Reach out to existing 1st- or 2nd-degree contacts inside the company.  
- Request an introduction or referral to the hiring manager.

A good referral vouches for your fit — it is not a request for special treatment.  
Its purpose is to elevate your visibility and move you to the interview round.

Once there, your interview performance determines the rest.

---

## 9. Factors Affecting Referrals

Contacts may weigh factors like:

- Strength of your professional relationship  
- Fit for the position  
- Proximity to the hiring manager  
- Company referral policies and past experiences  
- Internal workload and stability

Respect their decisions and remain gracious regardless of outcome.  
A declined referral can still leave a lasting positive impression.

---

## 10. Inside Connections

Even without direct referrals, **internal contacts** can help you:

- Identify good-fit positions early  
- Provide insight on company culture and leadership  
- Connect you with mentors  
- Help refine your application strategy  
- Check status of open positions or hiring timelines

---

## 11. Always Be Networking

Networking is a **continuous, career-long process** — not an activity limited to job searches.

Maintain active contact with your network:

- Aim for around **100 touchpoints per year** (messages, calls, meetups)  
- Keep at least a third of those as spoken conversations  
- Ask about others’ well-being, progress, and challenges  
- Share useful updates, insights, or introductions

Consistent, authentic outreach compounds over time into a resilient, opportunity-rich network.

---

## 12. Summary: Core Networking Principles

1. **Clarity precedes connection.** Know what you want.  
2. **Authenticity builds trust.** Approach networking as relationship-building.  
3. **Specificity creates opportunity.** Give contacts something concrete to help with.  
4. **Reciprocity sustains networks.** Offer value, not just requests.  
5. **Persistence compounds results.** Keep networking even when you don’t need a job.
